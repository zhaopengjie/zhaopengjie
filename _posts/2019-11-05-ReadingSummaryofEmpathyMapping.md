>The **Says** quadrant contains what the user says out loud in an interview or some other usability study. Ideally, it contains verbatim and direct quotes from research.

>“I am allegiant to Delta because I never have a bad experience.”


>The **Thinks** quadrant captures what the user is thinking throughout the experience. Ask yourself (from the qualitative research gathered): what occupies the user’s thoughts? What matters to the user? It is possible to have the same content in both Says and Thinks. However, pay special attention to what users think, but may not be willing to vocalize. Try to understand why they are reluctant to share — are they unsure, self-conscious, polite, or afraid to tell others something?

>“This is really annoying.”


>The **Does** quadrant encloses the actions the user takes. From the research, what does the user physically do? How does the user go about doing it?

>Refreshes page several times.


>The **Feels** quadrant is the user’s emotional state, often represented as an adjective plus a short sentence for context. Ask yourself: what worries the user? What does the user get excited about? How does the user feel about the experience?

>Impatient: pages load too slowly
